    The following code interfaces with the ball search module (which actually
    performs the ball search). Here's the interface if you want to write your
    own:

    MPF will post events when it wants certain things to happen, like
    "ball_search_begin_1"
    "ball_search_begin_2"
    "ball_search_end"

    You can use the following methods from our machine controller. (These
    examples assume it's in your ball search module as self.machine.)

    self.machine.get_balldevice_status()

    Returns a dictionary of ball devices, with the device object as the key
    and the number of balls it contains at the value.

    If you want to access a balldevice, they're accessible via:
    self.machine.balldevices[<device>].x

    Valid methods incude eject()
    With force=True to force it to fire the eject coil even if it thinks
    there's no ball.

    # todo that should trigger an eject in progress which the game can use to
    figure out where the ball came from.

    This ball search module is not reponsible for "finding" a ball. It just
    manages all the actions that take place during a search. The MPF Ball
    Controller will "find" any balls that are knocked loose and will then
    cancel the search.

    If you create your own, you should receive the instance of the machine_
    controller as an init paramter.

    You can fire coils via self.machine.coils[<coilname>].pulse()
