                   blend=False, tps=1000, num_repeats=0, callback=None):
        """Runs a light script. Scripts are similar to Shows, except they
        only apply to single lights and you can "attach" any script to any
        light. Scripts are used anytime you want an light to have more than one
        action. A simple example would be a flash an light. You would make a
        script that turned it on (with your color), then off, repeating
        forever.

        Scripts could be more complex, like cycling through multiple colors,
        blinking out secret messages in Morse code, etc.

        Interally we actually just take a script and dynamically convert it
        into a Show (that just happens to only be for a single light), so
        we can have all the other Show-like features, including playback
        speed, repeats, blends, callbacks, etc.

        Args:
            lightname: The name of the light for this script to control.
            script: A list of dictionaries of script commands. (See below)
                priority': The priority the light in this script should operate
                at.
            repeat (bool): Whether the script repeats (loops).
            blend (bool): Whether the script should blend the light colors with
                lower prioirty things. todo
            tps (int): Tocks per second. todo
            num_repeats (int): How many times this script should repeat before
                ending. A value of 0 indicates it will repeat forever. Also
                requires *repeat=True*. 'callback': A callback function that is
                called when the script is stopped. todo update

        Returns:
            :class:`Show` object. Since running a script just sets up and
            runs a regular Show, run_script returns the Show object.
            In most cases you won't need this, but it's nice if you want to
            know exactly which Show was created by this script so you can
            stop it later. (See the examples below for usage.)

        The script is a list of dictionaries, with each list item being a
        sequential instruction, and the dictionary defining what you want to
        do at that step. Dictionary items for each step are:

            color: The hex color for the light
            time: How long (in ms) you want the light to be at that color
            fade: True/False. Whether you want that light to fade to the color
                (using the *time* above), or whether you want it to switch to
                that color instantly.

        Example usage:

        Here's how you would use the script to flash an RGB light between red
        and off:

            self.flash_red = []
            self.flash_red.append({"color": "ff0000", "time": 100})
            self.flash_red.append({"color": "000000", "time": 100})
            self.machine.show_controller.run_script("light1", self.flash_red,
                                                     "4", blend=True)

        Once the "flash_red" script is defined as self.flash_red, you can use
        it anytime for any light. So if you want to flash two lights red, it
        would be:

            self.machine.show_controller.run_script("light1", self.flash_red,
                                                     "4", blend=True)
            self.machine.show_controller.run_script("light2", self.flash_red,
                                                     "4", blend=True)

        Most likely you would define your scripts once when the game loads and
        then call them as needed.

        You can also make more complex scripts. For example, here's a script
        which smoothly cycles an RGB light through all colors of the rainbow:

            self.rainbow = []
            self.rainbow.append({'color': 'ff0000', 'time': 400, 'fade': True})
            self.rainbow.append({'color': 'ff7700', 'time': 400, 'fade': True})
            self.rainbow.append({'color': 'ffcc00', 'time': 400, 'fade': True})
            self.rainbow.append({'color': '00ff00', 'time': 400, 'fade': True})
            self.rainbow.append({'color': '0000ff', 'time': 400, 'fade': True})
            self.rainbow.append({'color': 'ff00ff', 'time': 400, 'fade': True})

        If you have single color lights, your *color* entries in your script
        would only contain a single hex value for the intensity of that light.
        For example, a script to flash a single-color light on-and-off (which
        you can apply to any light):

            self.flash = []
            self.flash.append({"color": "ff", "time": 100})
            self.flash.append({"color": "00", "time": 100})

        If you'd like to save a reference to the :class:`Show` that's
        created by this script, call it like this:

            self.blah = self.machine.show_controller.run_script("light2",
                                                        self.flash_red, "4")
        """

        # convert the steps from the script list that was passed into the
        # format that's used in an Show

        show_actions = []

        for step in script:
            if step.get('fade', None):
                color = str(step['color']) + "-f" + str(step['time'])
            else:
                color = str(step['color'])

            color_dic = {lightname: color}

            - Specify *lightname* and *priority* to stop (and remove) all

            there's ever a situation where multiple shows want to control the
            same item, the one with the higher priority will win. ("Higher"
            means a bigger number, so a show with priority 2 will override a
            priority 1.)
        blend: Boolean which controls whether this show "blends" with lower
            priority shows and scripts. For example, if this show turns a light
            off, but a lower priority show has that light set to blue, then the
            light will "show through" as blue while it's off here. If you don't
            want that behavior, set blend to be False. Then off here will be off
            for sure (unless there's a higher priority show or command that turns
            the light on). Note that not all item types blend. (You can't blend a
            coil or event, for example.)
        hold: Boolean which controls whether the lights or LEDs remain in their
            final show state when the show ends.
        tocks_per_sec: Integer of how fast your show runs ("Playback speed," in
            other words.) Your Show files specify action times in terms of
            'tocks', like "make this light red for 3 tocks, then off for 4
            tocks, then a different light on for 6 tocks. When you play a show,
            you specify how many tocks per second you want it to play. Default
            is 32, but you might even want tocks_per_sec of only 1 or 2 if your
            show doesn't need to move than fast. Note this does not affect fade
            rates. So you can have tocks_per_sec of 1 but still have lights fade
            on and off at whatever rate you want. Also the term "tocks" was
            chosen so as not to confuse it with "ticks" which is used by the
            machine run loop.
        start_location: Integer of which position in the show file the show
            should start in. Usually this is 0 but it's nice to start part way
            through. Also used for restarting shows that you paused.
        callback: A callback function that is invoked when the show is stopped.
        num_repeats: Integer of how many times you want this show to repeat
            before stopping. A value of 0 means that it repeats indefinitely.
            Note this only works if you also have repeat=True.

        Example usage from a game:

        Load the show: (Note the MPF has a config option to automatically load
            all shows, which by default is True.
            self.show1 = lights.Show(self.machine,
            "Shows\\show1.yaml")

        Play the show:
            self.show1.play(repeat=True, tocks_per_sec=10, priority=3)

        Stop the show:
            self.show1.stop()

        Play the show again, but twice as fast as before
            self.show1.play(repeat=True, tocks_per_sec=20, priority=3)

        Play the show so it only repeats twice and then stops itself
            self.show1.play(repeat=True, tocks_per_sec=20, priority=3,
                            num_repeats=True)

        Play two shows at once:
            self.show1.play(repeat=True, tocks_per_sec=20, priority=3)
            self.show2.play(repeat=True, tocks_per_sec=5, priority=3)

        Play two shows at once, but have one be a higher priority meaning it
        will "win" if both shows want to control the same light at the same
        time:
            self.show1.play(repeat=True, tocks_per_sec=20, priority=4)
            self.show2.play(repeat=True, tocks_per_sec=5, priority=3)

    Args:
        machine: The main machine_controller object

    Each step in a playlist can contain more than one :class:`Show`. This
    is useful if you have a lot of little shows for different areas of the
    playfield that you want run at the same time. For example, you might have
    one show that only controls a group of rollover lane lights, and another
    which blinks the lights in the center of the playfield. You can run them at
    the by putting them in the same step in your playlist. (Note you don't need
    to use a playlist if you simply want to run two Shows at the same
    time. In that case you could just call :meth:`Show.play` twice to play
    both shows.

    For each "step" in the playlist, you can specify the number of seconds it
    runs those shows before moving on, or you can specify that one of the shows
    in that step plays a certain number of times and then the playlist moves
    to the next step from there.

    You create a show by creating an instance :class:`Playlist`. Then you
    add Shows to it via :meth:`add_show`. Finally, you specify the
    settings for each step (like how it knows when to move on) via :meth:
    `step_settings`.

    When you start a playlist (via :meth:`start`, you can specify
    settings like what priority the show runs at, whether it repeats, etc.)

        this for is to specify how the playlist knows to move on to the next
        step.

        Args:

        step: Integer for which step number you're configuring
        time: Integer of the time in seconds that you want this step to run
            before moving on to the next one.
        trigger_show: If you want to move to the next step after
            one of the Shows in this step is done playing, pass that show's object
            here. This is required because if there are multiple
            Shows in this step of the playlist which all end at different
            times, we wouldn't know which one to watch in order to know when to
            move on.

        Note that you can have repeats with a trigger show, but in that case
        you also need to have the num_repeats specified. Otherwise if you have
        your trigger show repeating forever then the playlist will never move
        on. (In that case use the *time* parameter to move on based on time.)

        priority: Integer of what priority you want the :class:`Show` shows in

        repeat_count: How many times you want this playlist to
            repeat before it stops itself. (Must be used with *repeat=True* above.)
            A value of 0 here means that this playlist repeats forever until you
            manually stop it. (This is ideal for attract mode.)
