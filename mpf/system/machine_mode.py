    """ A machine mode represents as special modes, the idea is there's only
    one at a time.

    You can specify an order so that when one ends, the next one starts.

    Examples:
        *Attract
        *Game
        *Match
        *Highscore Entry
        *Service

    The idea is the machine modes will control the buttons since they do
    different things in different modes. ("Buttons" versus "Switches" in this
    case. Buttons are things that players can control, like coin switches,
    control panel buttons, flippers, start, plunge, etc.)
