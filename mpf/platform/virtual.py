"""Contains code for a virtual hardware platform. At this point this is more
for testing before you have a P-ROC or FAST board installed. Eventually this
can be used to allow the MPF to drive PinMAME and Virtual Pinball machines.

This is similar to the P-ROC's 'FakePinPROC' mode of operation, though unlike
that it doesn't require any P-ROC drivers or modules to be installed.
